On device databases will be handled with core data. They include:
    - Physicians database
    - ICD codes
    - RAMQ codes
    
    ** Can incorporate core data code in UI if need be as no expectation to move those to cloud
    
Databases that have to be independent and able to change are:
    - patients
    - acts
    - lists
    
    **  Have to make the all the UI independent of references to a specific framework of persistence.
        Be able to change from core data to firebase for example without having to change the UI code
